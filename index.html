        We all heard the track "Animals". Because it sounded last year, everywhere and from everywhere. The author is <ins>Martin Garrix</ins>. Today, the video has scored more than 288 million views on <b>YouTube</b>. No one previously known DJ entered the DJ Mag Top 100 and became one of the most popular at the biggest music festivals.

        The most interesting thing in this whole story is that Martin is a simple Dutch schoolboy. In November, when he first headed the UK singles chart with the track <ins>Animals</ins>, he was only 17 years old. DJ became the second youngest artist..

      <p>Have fun:
        <blockquote>I did not even expect that “Animals” would be so successful. I watched the song go up in charts around the world, but the debut came first in the UK - I couldn't even expect it.</blockquote>

        Music lessons the guy started with the study of Spanish guitar. When he managed to “conquer” the sultry beauty, he realized that with her sweet voice you need to do something. Then he got into the wilds of computer production, downloaded <abbr title="Fruity Loops Studion">FlS</abbr> and realized that he had found a new love.

        <i>My first party was held at my home in 2010. About 400 people gathered at that time, I remember that moment perfectly. It was my birthday, and I asked all my friends to take more acquaintances with them</i>

      <p>I often forget that I am 17 years old:
        <blockquote>I am surrounded by people much older than me - not just DJs, for example, the average age of party visitors is about 21 years. However, age is just a figure.</blockquote>

        <q> but I still can't drive a car! You know, it's all a bit strange. On Saturday night I play in Las Vegas or Ibiza, and on Monday I go to school</q>
